AChoir - Beta v0.28


What is AChoir:
===============
Every Incident Responder eventually comes to the conclusion that they need to script their 
favorite Live Acquisition utilities.  For some reason (or many reasons) many of those Live 
Acquisition scripts are often shrouded in mystery and shared only among trusted parties.

I have seen these scripts written in numerous scripting languages - but oddly enough, all of 
these scripts tend to use many of the same freely available utilities - To do mostly the 
same things.

It often takes a Responder several years, along with lots of trial and error to settle on a 
set of utilities (and options) that both work and that provide relevant information on useful 
forensic artifacts.

And even though Responders often use the same utilities and are scripting them in largely 
the same way, each Responder has to go through the same pain of building their own script in 
their (not so) favorite scripting language - figuring out how to quickly and consistently 
gather the artifacts of most value. 

I believe that this process of re-inventing the wheel over and over again is just silly. 

That's why I wrote AChoir.



So How is AChoir different?
===========================
AChoir has several goals:

1. Identify the best free forensic utilities
2. Make it easy to get these utilities and...
3. Automate the building of Acquisition toolkits with them
4. Self Document
5. Build a Framework for Live Acquisition Scripts/Toolkits
6. Minimize the impact of the scripting function on artifacts
7. Move towards a repository model for Acquisition utilities
8. Make remote acquisition as easy as local acquisition (this will be a future goal).


Achoir itself is architected with two primary functional concepts:

1. To download the Acquisition utilities and organize them into a Acquisition Toolkit
2. To Run those utilities (Toolkit) in an organized way.


An AChoir script can download, and unzip these utilities in order to create a Live 
Acquisition Toolkit.  We have provided our version of a "Build" script, but you can 
make your own.

The idea is to make it easily repeatable to download and organize these utilities.  
That is: with just AChoir and a builder script, anyone can build an Acquisition 
Scripting Toolkit.

This has the additional benefit of documenting where everything came from.

The second functional concept of running the Acquisition Script to gather artifacts is 
obvious.  But what AChoir tries to do is make that experience consistent and repeatable.  
Achoir creates unique directories for every Acquisition run, and has built in functions 
like hashing.  In this way we are creating both a consistent framework and a scripting 
language that is targeted specifically at Live Acquisition.



So Isn't This Just another Scripting Language?  I can do that already.
======================================================================
I would say, you could do everything Achoir does with any scripting language - If that 
is what you want to do.  In fact, that is how AChoir started life.  But Achoir's goals 
are to make Live Acquisition scripting consistent and to eventually create a respository 
for Live Acquisition utilities to make the whole process easier for Responders.

We are also very sensitive to the "Observer Effect" problem when Acquiring artifacts, 
and Achoir will be coded in a way to minimize disturbing the artifacts.  This takes some 
work when writing your own Live Acquisition scripting programs.



OK. I'm Sold.  How does it work?
================================
The Achoir scripting language has two primary concepts:

1. Objects
2. Actions


Actions are the thing you want to do.  Objects are the thing(s) you want to do the Actions 
against.  Actions always start in column 1, they are three letters folowed by a colon(:).  
Objects Can go anywhere and start with an ampersand(&) followed by three letters.


Here is a simple example:
Dir:\Test
Say:The Current Directory is: &Dir


In this example, a lot of things are going on.  First the &Dir object is being set by the DIR: 
action.  In addition, if that directory does not exist it will be created.  All directories are 
created RELATIVE to the directory Achoir was run from. doing this ensures consistency every 
time Achoir is run, and prevents one set of artifacts from stepping on another set.

The next statement (SAY:) then prints the text and &Dir object to both the screen, and a unique 
LogFile for each run. 


Here is another Example:
ACQ:\Reg
FOR:C:\Users\NTUSER.DAT
SYS:XCopy &For "&Acq\NTUSER.DAT(&Num)" /H


In this example our goal is to Copy all User NTUSER.DAT Registry files under the C:\USERS Directory. 
To do this we would use the "FOR:" Action and the &For Object.

First we set the Acquisition Sub-Directory (ACQ:) object (&Acq) to "\Reg"  This is a path directly 
under the unique generated Acquisition Directory.

Next, the &For object is set to any/all NTUSER.DAT files found in any subdirectory under 
C:\Users (Note: wildcards are also valid).  The &For object also has an &Num object automatically 
associated to it, to distinguish each file.

The next (SYS:) statement can then copy all of those files to the &Acq directory and give each 
file a unique name using the &Num object.  The concept that makes this happen with a single 
command is the &For object.



Here is a list of all the Actions and Objects:


Actions:
========
SAY:     Echo Text and Objects to the Screen and Logfile
INP:     Input from console. (INP:<Display This Text>)
         Display text and get input into variable &Inp 
         IMPORTANT NOTE: Longer input is TRUNCATED to 250 chars
INI:     SWITCH to another Script File (INI:F:\NewScript.Acq)
         Note: This WILL NOT RETURN to the calling script.
GET:     Get a file using HTTP
EXE:     Run a Program
SYS:     Execute a System Command
USR:     <UserId> to use when mapping a drive (Optional)
PWD:     <Password> to use when mapping a drive (Optional)
MAP:     Map to a remote drive share (\\<server>\<share>) and use 
         it as the Acquisition Directory 
ACQ:     Tell Achoir to create a unique Acquisition directory
DIR:     Set the &Dir object and create the directory if needed
FIL:     Set the &Fil object (File)
HSH:ACQ  Hash everything in the &ACQ directory and subdirectories
HSH:Dir  Hash everything in the &DIR directory and subdirectories
FOR:     Set the &FOR object.  This is a Looping object based on 
         Files - For instance "FOR:C:\Users\*.DAT" will define
         All *.DAT Files under C:\Users. In this way a single 
         command can be run iteratively against all of these files. 
CPY:     Copy Files (CPY:<FromFile> <ToFile>) - Supports Quotes
ARN:     Search Registry Run Key and copy the EXEs 
         (possible malware persistence)
CKY:     Check if a File exists. If it does, run until an "END:" 
         action
CKN:     Check if a File does not exist. If it doesn't, run until 
         an "END:" action
RC=:     If the Last GET:, SYS: or EXE: command was this return code
         run the statements until an END:
RC!:     If the Last GET:, SYS: or EXE: command was NOT this return code
         run the statements until an END:
RC>:     If the Last GET:, SYS: or EXE: command return code was >
         run the statements until an END:
RC<:     If the Last GET:, SYS: or EXE: command return code was <
         run the statements until an END:
END:     End Conditional Statement execution.



Objects:
========
&Dir     The Current Directory Object
&Inp     Input from console (INP: Action) 
&Fil     The Current File Object
&Acq     The Current Acquisition Directory
&For     An array of File objects set by the FOR: action
&Num     The array number of each &For Object
&Win     The Windows Root Directory
&CHK     The FileName that was Checked for (non) existence by the
         CKN: and CKY: actions
&RCD     The Last Return Code set by a SYS: or EXE: action
&Drv     A variable used to hold a Drive Letter (C:, D:, etc...)
&Map     A variable used to hold the last Mapped Drive Letter (Z:, Y:, etc...)
&Tmp     The Window %Temp% variable
&FNM     Each &FOR File Name (Without Path)

%<variable>% - AChoir can also expand the native DOS/Windows Environment Variables
 Note: To use a native % (prevent expansion) in a script, use %% 


Here are the Command Line Options:
/HELP - Help
/BLD  - Run the Build.ACQ Script (Build the AChoir Toolkit)
        Note: This option WILL NOT Create an Acquisition Base Directory - BE AWARE!
/RUN  - Run the AChoir.ACQ Script to do a Live Acquisition
        This option WILL Create a Base Acquisition Directory
/MNU  - Run the Menu.ACQ Script (AChoir Menu)
        Note: This is a simple Menu Script for selecting an AChoir script to run.
/INI:<File Name>  - Run the <File Name> script instead of AChoir.ACQ
        This Option WILL NOT Create a Base Acquisition Directory
        Use the ACQ: action to create the Base Acquisition Directory if you want one. 
/DRV:<x:> - Set the &DRV parameter
        This option is designed to allow you to build dead-box scripts,
        and specify a drive variable (the drive letter that has been mounted).
/USR:<UserId> - UserId to use when mapping a drive (Optional)
/PWD:<Password> - Password to use when mapping a drive (Optional)
/MAP:<\\Server\Share> - Map a network drive - THIS SETS THE ACQUISITION AND 
      CURRENT DIRECTORIES TO THE MAPPED DRIVE - This is mostly used for REMOTE
      Acquisition 



Artifacts that AChoir itself generates:
Achoir itself will generate a few files.  These are meant to increase non-repudiation
and make the artifacts easier to use.

Logfile (ACQ-IR-<name>-<date>-<time>.txt
----------------------------------------
Achoir will create a logfile for each acquisition in the /Logs directory.
The log contains both the actions taken by AChoir and additional information
such as the hash of each program that is run.

DirHash.txt
-----------
When requested in the AChoir Script (HSH:DIR), Achoir will hash all files starting
at the directory AChoir is run from (AChoir's root directory) and store the MD5 hashes 
in this file.

ACQHash.txt
-----------
When requested in the AChoir Script (HSH:ACQ), Achoir will hash all acquired 
artifacts and store the MD5 hashes in this file.

Index.htm
---------
Achoir will generate an Index.htm file for every acquisition.  This file can 
be opened with your favorite web browser to browse and open the acquired
artifacts.  This is an incredibly simple but useful feature.  



Last Thoughts:
The AChoir language is pretty simple.  And I will do my best to keep it that way.  To best 
understand it, please take a look at the Build.ACQ and Achoir.ACQ scripts
