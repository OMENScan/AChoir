AChoir - v2.6

AChoir
======
AChoir continues to mature.  My goals are to make it a flexible scripting language designed
to gathering windows forensic artifacts locally or remotely, and to limit its footprint by 
using techniques that limit what AChoir itself leaves behind as artifacts.


What is AChoir:
===============
Every Incident Responder eventually comes to the conclusion that they need to script their 
favorite Live Acquisition utilities.  For some reason (or many reasons) many of those Live 
Acquisition scripts are often shared only among trusted parties.

I have seen these scripts written in numerous scripting languages - but oddly enough, all of 
these scripts tend to use many of the same freely available utilities - To do mostly the 
same things.

It often takes a Responder several years, along with lots of trial and error to settle on a 
set of utilities (and options) that both work, and that provide relevant information on useful 
forensic artifacts.

And even though Responders often use the same utilities and are scripting them in largely 
the same way, each Responder has to go through the same pain of building their own script in 
their (not so) favorite scripting language - figuring out how to quickly and consistently 
gather the artifacts of most value and limit the scripting footprint. 

I believe that this process of re-inventing the wheel over and over again is just silly. 

That's why I wrote AChoir.



So How is AChoir different?
===========================
AChoir has several goals:

1. Identify the best free forensic utilities
2. Make it easy to get these utilities and...
3. Automate the building of Acquisition toolkits with them
4. Self Document
5. Build a Framework for Live Acquisition Scripts/Toolkits
6. Minimize the impact of the scripting function on artifacts
7. Move towards a repository model for Acquisition utilities
8. Make remote acquisition as easy as local acquisition


Achoir itself is architected with two primary functional concepts:

1. To download the Acquisition utilities and organize them into a Acquisition Toolkit
2. To Run those utilities (Toolkit) in an organized way.


An AChoir script can download, and unzip these utilities in order to create a Live 
Acquisition Toolkit.  We have provided our version of a "Build" script, but you can 
make your own.

The idea is to make it easily repeatable to download and organize these utilities.  
That is: with just AChoir and a builder script, anyone can build an Acquisition 
Scripting Toolkit.

This has the additional benefit of documenting where everything came from.

The second functional concept of running the Acquisition Script to gather artifacts is 
obvious.  But what AChoir tries to do is make that experience consistent and repeatable.  
Achoir creates unique directories for every Acquisition run, and has built in functions 
like hashing and Raw NTFS File Copy.  In this way we are creating both a consistent 
framework and a scripting language that is targeted specifically at Live Acquisition.



So Isn't This Just another Scripting Language?  I can do that already.
======================================================================
I would say, you could almost everything Achoir does with any scripting language - If that 
is what you want to do.  In fact, that is how AChoir started life.  But Achoir's goals 
are to make Live Acquisition scripting consistent and to eventually create a respository 
for Live Acquisition utilities to make the whole process easier for Responders.

We are also very sensitive to the "Observer Effect" problem when Acquiring artifacts, 
and Achoir will continue to be coded in a way to minimize disturbing the artifacts.  This 
takes some work when writing your own Live Acquisition scripting programs.



OK. I'm Sold.  How does it work?
================================
The Achoir scripting language has two primary concepts:

1. Objects
2. Actions


Actions are the thing you want to do.  Objects are the thing(s) you want to do the Actions 
against.  Actions always start in column 1, they are three letters folowed by a colon(:).

  Note:As of AChoir v0.99 Actions can be indented using tabs or spaces.

Objects Can go anywhere and start with an ampersand(&) followed by three letters.


Here is a simple example:
Dir:\Test
Say:The Current Directory is: &Dir


In this example, a lot of things are going on.  First the &Dir object is being set by the DIR: 
action.  In addition, if that directory does not exist it will be created.  All directories are 
created RELATIVE to the directory Achoir was run from. doing this ensures consistency every 
time Achoir is run, and prevents one set of artifacts from stepping on another set.

The next statement (SAY:) then prints the text and &Dir object to both the screen, and a unique 
LogFile for each run. 


Here is another Example:

ACQ:\Reg
NCP:"C:\Users\*\NTUSER.DAT" "&Acq"


In this example our goal is to Copy all User NTUSER.DAT Registry files under the C:\USERS Directory.
We want to do this using AChoir's built-in NTFS Raw Copy Action.  Using AChoir's NTFS Raw Copy
allows us to copy open and locked files, and bypasses the NTFS file system to avoid modifying any
Time Stamps.  We do this to make the footprint as small as possible to make the File Copy more
"forensically sound" by preventing unwanted modifications to the file system (Accessed) TimeStamps.

First we set the Acquisition Sub-Directory (ACQ:) object (&Acq) to "\Reg"  This is a path directly 
under the unique generated Acquisition Directory.

Next, the NCP: action copies any/all NTUSER.DAT files found in any NTFS subdirectory under 
C:\Users (Note: wildcards are also valid) into the &Acq directory.


Here is a list of all the Actions and Objects:


Actions:
========
SET:NCP=NODCMP  Sets the NCP: (NTFS Raw Copy) to NOT
                DeCompress LZNT1 compressed files.
                Instead, the RAW Compressed data will
                be extracted (and must be manually 
                decompressed to use it). 
SET:NCP=DECOMP  DeCOMPRESS LZNT1 files.  This is more  
     or         forensically sound. Since LZNT1 compressed
SET:NCP=RAWONLY files are not usable in their RAW COMPRESSED
                form, AChoir will attempt to decompress 
                the file using a built-in LZNT1 Decompressor.
                Note: There will be TWO files: The original 
                COMPRESSED file (LZ) AND an UNcompressed version 
                with the original file name (or possibly an "(LX)"
                extension (see below).
SET:NCP=OSCOPY  Sets the NCP: (NTFS Raw Copy) to  
                copy a file using the OS API if 
                DeCOMPRESSION ERRORS are encountered. This is 
                a CHANGE from AChoir 1.9 behavior. This is not 
                as forensically sound (it may leave artifacts)
                as the DECOMP/RAWONLY option.
                Note1: This setting will ONLY call OS Copying
                if the LZNT1 DeCompression has ERRORS. 
                Note2: THREE files can be created: The original 
                COMPRESSED file (LZ), a Decompressed version with 
                a "(LX)" appended, and a THIRD copy of the file
                written through OSCopying with the original file 
                name.
SAY:     Echo Text and Objects to the Screen and Logfile

ADM:Check Check if AChoir is running as an Administrator,
           and warn if it is not
ADM:Force  Check if AChoir is running as an Administrator,

Sig:<Typ=xxxx> 
         Loads a File Signature ino the Signature Table. The first 
         variable is the File Type, the second is the Hex Signature
         (must be in the form of XX).
         Signature Type can be up to 10 bytes (i.e JPG, JPEG, MOV, etc)
         Signatures can be up to 32 Chars (16 bytes)

         (possible malware persistence)
ARN:<Offline Registry> 
         By adding an Explicit Path to a SOFTWARE Offline Registry 
         File, AChoir will try to find the Run Keys and copy the 
         EXEs.  This is the DeadBox equivalent of ARN:
USB:Protect  Sets the Windows USB WriteProtect Registry key to 1
             (Enable USB Write Protection) - Newly attached USB 
             devices will be write protected by Windows

A note about Conditonal Logic 
(CKY:, 64B:, 32B:, CKN:, RC=:, RC!:, RC>:, RC<:, END:, LBL:, JMP:, VER:)
----------
Conditional Logic doesn't make much sense in Interactive Mode (/CON), but you may want to know 
these various conditions.  AChoir is coded to give the results of these comparisons in 
Interactive Mode, and to take Conditional Action in regular Scripted Mode.  In Interactive Mode
Achoir WILL NOT take conditional action.


A note about Case Information (/CSE, CSE:GET, CSE:SAY)
----------
To avoid any accidental confusion about Case information (that may jeopardize non-repudiation),
I have coded AChoir to disallow changing Case information after it has been displayed. Some may
find this draconian, but it is important to avoid ambiguity when doing forensic analysis, so 
I have chosen to disallow changing Case information even if the default settings are displayed.

Also Note: Case Information is entirely optional - You can use AChoir without entering any 
           Case Information, and this is the default (so AChoir can run fully unattended)


A note about NTP (NTP: and &NTP)
----------
Achoir can query an NTP server to display the Accurate Time.  This is most useful when identifying
Time Drift when gathering artifacts. For Example: 

 NTP:windows.time.com
 SAY:Local Time: &Tim - NTP Time: &Ntp

BY DEFAULT NONE of the default/provided scripts use NTP.  This is for three reasons:
 1. It's bad form to put NTP servers in any default config files.
 2. It opens a UDP Port (123) and communicates with an NTP server, and that may be 
    considered contamination.
 3. NTP is UDP and it may not work in situations where NAT is used and/or NTP is blocked
    (Your Firewall may need to be configured to allow NTP)

AChoir's NTP client may be useful in many situations to identify Time Drift, but please take
into account the issues above before using this function.


A note about EXE: EXA: and EXB:
----------
Under normal circumstances I recommend using EXE: to execute programs, it is much easier to 
control the script when things are run sequentially, but in cases where there may be several 
machines running AChoir, or Execution Time is limited or important, one may want to run 
several programs Concurrently or in the Background.  The primary problem with this method 
is that one cannot know when these Asynchoronously run programs will complete. 

Use EXA: and EXB: judiciously, bearing in mind that NOT ONLY will they complete at different 
times, but the AChoir Script ITSELF will continue to run as these programs also run in 
parrallel.  In fact, AChoir could even complete and exit while these programs are still 
executing.  This can have major implications for your AChoir scripts. 


A note about System32 File ReDirection:
----------
When Non-Native programs (for instance 32 bit programs on 64 Bit Windows) are run, the 
Operating System will redirect files located in the %SystemRoot%\System32 directory to 
a different directory.  This directory can be different based on circumstances, but its
alias is always %SystemRoot%\Sysnative.  I am slowly building this into all the parts 
of AChoir.  This can be seen in the CPY: and NCP: Copy functions and the FOR: function.

Achoir will try to detect if it is not running Native, and will adjust some of it's 
actions based on that.  Whenever AChoir does this, it will note it on the screen and
in the Acquisition Log.

One may wonder - why not just use whatever Windows tells us.  The answer to that is 
simple: If we are running AChoir on an endpoint, we may be interested in BOTH the 
32Bit artifacts AND the 64Bit artifacts.  Since BOTH can be present, and BOTH may 
be relevant to an investigation, AChoir will always try to get both artifacts if 
it can.


A note about LZNT1 Decompression
----------
Building a working LZNT1 decompressor has been a huge challenge.  With the addition of 
Yogesh Khatri's bug fixes, I believe it is now stable.  Nonetheless, I am leaving in the 
LZNT1 decompressor fallback:

1. If an NTFS file is compressed AChoir will identify it and copy the raw data file
   preserving the compression.  It will append an (LZ) extention to the file to identify it as 
   an LZNT1 compressed file.
2. AChoir will then try to decompress the raw data into ANOTHER file.  It will try to use the 
   original file name (this makes identifying the files easier).
3. If that doesn't work properly it will append an (LX) extentions to the file (LZNT1 Xtracted)
   and it will then use standard OS APIs to copy the file with original name

You can therefore have up to 3 copies of the same file:
* Raw compressed file (LZ)
* Uncompressed file created by AChoir LZNT1 decompressor (LX)
* Uncompressed file using standard OS Copy (decompress through the OS)

If you are concerned with Forensic soundness, you can TURN OFF the OS Copy routine using the SET:NCP=RAWONLY option in AChoir.  This may mean that you will not have a working/readable file, and you will need to extract that file using another means.

I am continually working on the LZNT1 decompressor to make it more resilient to errors.


Artifacts that AChoir itself generates:
----------
Achoir itself will generate a few files.  These are meant to increase non-repudiation
and make the artifacts easier to use.

Logfile (ACQ-IR-<name>-<date>-<time>.txt
----------------------------------------
Achoir will create a logfile for each acquisition in the /Logs directory.
The log contains both the actions taken by AChoir and additional information
such as the hash of each program that is run.

DirHash.txt
-----------
When requested in the AChoir Script (HSH:DIR), Achoir will hash all files starting
at the directory AChoir is run from (AChoir's root directory) and store the MD5 hashes 
in this file.

ACQHash.txt
-----------
When requested in the AChoir Script (HSH:ACQ), Achoir will hash all acquired 
artifacts and store the MD5 hashes in this file.

Index.htm
---------
Achoir will generate an Index.htm file for every acquisition.  This file can 
be opened with your favorite web browser to browse and open the acquired
artifacts.  This is an incredibly simple but useful feature.  

x-MFT.db
---------
Achoir will generate an SQLite database when using NCP: Raw Copy.  This database is
a subset of the $MFT for that volume - used to make searching for wildcards faster.

ForFiles
---------
Achoir will create a temporary file in the Acquisition Cache Directory called "ForFiles"
every time the FOR: Action is used.  ForFiles contains the results and is used when the 
&FOR Looping object (variable) is used.

ForDisks
---------
Achoir will create a temporary file in the Acquisition Cache Directory called "ForDisks"
every time the DSK: Action is used.  ForDisks contains the results and is used when the 
&DSK Looping object (variable) is used.


Acknowledgements:
IMPORTANT NOTE: I could not have implemented the NTFS Raw Copy Function without the Excellent NTFS tutorial at:

http://www.installsetupconfig.com/win32programming/windowsvolumeapis1index.html<br>

Much of the code in the Achoir NTFS Raw Copy function is directly from this tutorial.  And I want to publicly thank 
them for making this example code available.

AChoir also heavily uses the LZNT1 decompression code from ReactOS at:
https://doxygen.reactos.org/d0/dd2/sdk_2lib_2rtl_2compress_8c_source.html


Last Thoughts:
The AChoir language is pretty simple.  And I will do my best to keep it that way.  To best 
understand it, please take a look at the Build.ACQ and Achoir.ACQ scripts
